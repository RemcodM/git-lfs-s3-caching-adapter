LFS objects in a S3 bucket.

It uses the underlying Git LFS implementation to perform transfers using the
LFS configuration you set-up for your repository, but additionally caches the
downloaded/uploaded objects in a S3 bucket you configure. This way, it is
possbile to cache large objects at a closer edge location, possibly reducing
download time and bandwidth costs.`,
